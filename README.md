<b>Abstract:</b>

One of the most common errors when starting to develop wearable apps is to try to replicate the functionality of your handset on a wearable. It's important to keep in mind that wearable apps shoud be quite small in size and functionality. They are a complement for your phone and we must develop our apps keeping this premise. In this talk I'll explain the process followed to develop a wearable remote control for the NowTV box, covering some basic aspects of the communication between the phone and the wearable.
